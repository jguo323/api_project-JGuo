# api_project-JGuo


The API used is a based on New York Monuments. The pie chart will show how each borough compares to each other when it comes to number of monuments. The line graph can map out the increase of monuments in each borough over the years. The charts may help people who are interested in monuments select the best borough to visit. The first graph shows a pie chart of the 5 boroughs of New York (Staten Island, Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx). This chart will show the number of monuments in each borough and how they compare to each other.  The second graph is a line chart of two lines representing the boroughs with the most amount of monuments. It will show the pace at which each borough erect monuments over the past 100 years. The x axis represents the year and the y axis displays the number of monuments that exists in the borough that given year. The charts can show people where to visit in New York City based on their location. People may be attracted to area with more monuments and visit based on that information.
